# AI-Powered-Paper-Correction-using-Generative-AI  

## 📌 Overview  
This project automates the evaluation of student answer sheets using **Generative AI**. It extracts text from PDFs, compares student responses with teacher-provided answers, and generates AI-driven feedback along with scores. The system supports multiple **LLMs (Large Language Models)**, including **Gemini API** and **Ollama (LLaMA 3.2:3B)**, offering flexibility in AI evaluation.  

## 🚀 Features  
- 📄 **Automated Answer Sheet Evaluation** – Extracts text from student and teacher PDFs.  
- 📝 **AI-Powered Assessment** – Supports both **Gemini API** and **Ollama LLMs** for evaluation.  
- 🎯 **Detailed Feedback Generation** – Provides concise feedback based on accuracy, clarity, and relevance.  
- 📊 **PDF Report Generation** – Saves evaluation results in a structured PDF file.  
- 🔄 **Open-Source & Scalable** – Built using open-source technologies for adaptability and cost-effectiveness.
